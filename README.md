# Octo Preview

A Chrome extension that displays live previews of Markdown comments while you type. Works with Issues + Pull Requests + Gists. *Should* support GitHub Enterprise (*but it is currently untested*).

**Note** This extension relies on making HTTP requests frequently as you type to get the parsed/rendered Markdown output from GitHub. Not recommended for users on slower connections.
